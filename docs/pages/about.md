The Homelab Club at the University of Maryland exists to foster a hands-on learning environment where students can explore system administration, networking, virtualization, cybersecurity, self-hosting, and other homelab-related skills. The club aims to build a supportive community where students of all skill levels can collaborate and experiment in a curiosity-driven environment, gaining practical, real-world experience that supports both academic growth and professional development. Through workshops, peer mentorship, and shared resources, the Homelab Club encourages innovation, self-reliance, and a deeper understanding of how computing systems work from the ground up.
