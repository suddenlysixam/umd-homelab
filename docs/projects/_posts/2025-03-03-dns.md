# Prerequisites

## What you will need

This project assumes that you have already followed our [Raspberry Pi installation](https://suddenlysixam.club/meetings/past_meetings/2024-12-02-meeting.html) project, and have the resulting configured Raspberry Pi. If you are installing on different hardware or a different OS, these steps may not all be the same for you.

## Quick Review: What is DNS?

**(D)omain (N)ame (S)ystem**

Make DNS queries to lookup DNS records.

Very short explanation of some types of DNS records:

- A: "address", hostname -> IP address
- AAAA: "address x4" hostname -> IPv6 address
- PTR: "pointer", IP address -> hostname
- CNAME: "canonical name", hostname -> hostname
- MX: "mail exchange"
- TXT: "text"
- NS: "nameserver"

> &#9432; **Note:** This is just a quick review! Check out our last presentation for more info: [https://suddenlysixam.club/meetings/past_meetings/2025-02-24-meeting.html](https://suddenlysixam.club/meetings/past_meetings/2025-02-24-meeting.html)

> &#9432; **Note:** IPv4 32 bits, IPv6 128 bits, 32 x 4 = 128)

## Commands to help us test

### host
{:.no_toc}

host - DNS lookup utility ([man page](https://manpages.debian.org/bookworm/bind9-host/host.1.en.html))

e.g.

```
host google.com
```

### nslookup
{:.no_toc}

nslookup - query Internet name servers interactively ([man page](https://manpages.debian.org/bookworm/bind9-dnsutils/nslookup.1.en.html))

e.g.

```
nslookup google.com
```

```
nslookup -type=ns google.com
```

```
nslookup google.com 1.1.1.1
```

### dig
{:.no_toc}

dig - DNS lookup utility ([man page](https://manpages.debian.org/bookworm/bind9-dnsutils/dig.1.en.html))

e.g.

```
dig google.com
```

### ping
{:.no_toc}

ping â€” send ICMP ECHO_REQUEST packets to network hosts ([man page](https://manpages.debian.org/bookworm/inetutils-ping/ping.1.en.html))

e.g.

```
ping google.com
```

```
ping google.com -c 4
```

# Raspberry Pi BIND9 Setup

## Basic Pi Configuration

### Package installation: updates & basic network

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install vim bind9-dnsutils
```

> &#9432; **Note:** `bind9-dnsutils` gives us (among other things) `nslookup` & `dig`. It has a package dependency for `bind9-host` which gives us `host`.

> &#9432; **Note:** `dnsutils` is a transitional package for `bind9-dnsutils`. So we will not use it here, but you may see `dnsutils` used in other guides.

### Set hostname

```
sudo vim /etc/hosts
sudo vim /etc/hostname
sudo shutdown -r now
```

One the host has finished rebooting, check to see if your changes applied:

```
hostname
```

> &#9432; **Note:** You might ask, why not use `sudo hostnamectl set-hostname <your-hostname>`? If you are curious, you can run this and then `cat` the mentioned files, and see what has changed.

> &#9432; **Note:** After you set the hostname and before you reboot, it may yell at you about the previous hostname name/service not being known.

### Local name resolution

Add a different hostname to `/etc/hosts`:

```
sudo vim /etc/hosts
```

Then let's test the behavior of a few different commands:

```
host <hostname>
nslookup <hostname>
dig <hostname>
ping <hostname>
```

> &#9432; **Note:** You can test what happens with your own device's hostname that we configured in the last step too.

### Set a static IP

In our case, we will be using _NetworkManager_ to set a static IP.

```
nmcli
nmcli connection show
```

Take note of the "Name" of the connection you are using. (NOT the "Device". Sometimes these will be the same, but not always.)

```
nmcli con mod "<connection-name>" ipv4.addresses <ip-address>/<subnet-mask>
nmcli con mod "<connection-name>" ipv4.gateway <gateway-ip-address>
nmcli con mod "<connection-name>" ipv4.method manual
nmcli con down "<connection-name>" && nmcli con up "<connection-name>"
```

```
nmcli
```

> &#9432; **Note:** How you set a static IP will greatly vary by OS and OS version.

> &#9432; **Note:** Some parts of these commands can be shortened, such as `connection` > `con`. Some can be shortened even further.

> &#9432; **Note:** `sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager` will add the new config, but will not remove the old, which is not ideal. This is why we are running the `up` and `down` commands for the connection. You could also reboot your pi.

> &#9432; **Note:** `<subnet-mask>` based on the netmask
> Subnet mask cheat sheet: [https://dnsmadeeasy.com/support/subnet](https://dnsmadeeasy.com/support/subnet)

## BIND9 Configuration

### Package installation: BIND9

```
sudo apt install bind9 bind9-utils
```

(optional)

```
sudo apt install bind9-doc
```

> &#9432; **Note:** BIND9 is not the only choice, it is just our choice

> &#9432; **Note:** `bind9` for the service, `bind9-utils` for ways to check our work, `bind9-docs` for documentation.)
> Additional package info: [https://www.kali.org/tools/bind9/](https://www.kali.org/tools/bind9/)

> &#9432; **Note:** `bind9utils` is a transitional package for `bind9-utils`. So we will not use it here, but you may see `bind9utils` used in other guides.)

### Configuration files

#### /etc/systemd/system/bind9.service
{:.no_toc}

First, lets look at the systemd service for bind9:

```
cat /etc/systemd/system/bind9.service
```

Take note of:\
`EnvironmentFile=-/etc/default/named`\
`ExecStart=/usr/sbin/named -f $OPTIONS`\
`Alias=bind9.service`

> &#9432; **Note:** In the `bind9.service` file, the `=-`, indicates that if the file does not exist, it will not be read and no error or warning message is logged.

Next lets take a look at the current status of the service:

```
systemctl status bind9
systemctl status named
```

#### /etc/init.d/named
{:.no_toc}

Because of what we have now observed, lets look at the `named` service script:

```
cat /etc/init.d/named | less
```

We can see that this has a comment about creating/changing `/etc/default/named` (and this was the `EnvironmentFile` that we noted earlier), so let's take a look at that next.

#### /etc/default/named
{:.no_toc}

```
sudo vim /etc/default/named
```

Lets configure this to run only on IPv4 by adding `-4` to the options.

Default: `OPTIONS="-u bind"`\
Change to: `OPTIONS="-u bind -4"`

#### /etc/bind/named.conf
{:.no_toc}

```
cat /etc/bind/named.conf
```

You should see 3 included conf files, which we are going to begin configuring for different things:\
`/etc/bind/named.conf.options` (ACLs, forwarders, port, etc.)\
`/etc/bind/named.conf.local` (declare our zones)\
`/etc/bind/named.conf.default-zones` (default zone declarations)

Throughout this you may also want to be checking your work, but I am not going to list this command after every step. Validate your changes as you go.

```
sudo named-checkconf
```

#### named.conf.options
{:.no_toc}

> &#9432; **Note:** If you would like to look at all the options, and installed `bind9-doc`, you can take a look at `/usr/share/doc/bind9/options.gz`.

Add an (A)ccess (C)ontrol (L)ist:

```
sudo vim /etc/bind/named.conf.options
```

Put the following statement above the `options {...}` statement:

```
acl trusted {
        10.70.50.0/24;
        localhost;
        localnets;
};
```

> &#9432; **Note:**BIND has the following built-in ACLs:\
> `none`: Matches no hosts.\
> `any`: Matches all hosts.\
> `localhost`: 127.0.0.1 and ::1, as well as the IP addresses of all interfaces on the server that runs BIND.\
> `localnets`: 127.0.0.1 and ::1, as well as all subnets the server that runs BIND is directly connected to.

> &#9432; **Note:** You could put the ACL directly in `named.conf`, however since we are going to use it in `named.conf.options` I'm putting it here.

**Now add some configuration within the `options {...}` statement:**

Allow DNS queries from the ACL we defined:

```
    allow-query     { trusted; };
    allow-recursion { trusted; };    # allow them to recursively query authoritative DNS servers for the queried domain
```

Forward requests for records that this server does not have:

```
    forward only;    # don't attempt to contact other NS if forwarders not available
    forwarders {
      1.1.1.1;
      1.0.0.1;
    };
```

Only IPv4. Change the second IP to that of the pi.

```
    listen-on port 53 { 127.0.0.1; 10.70.50.104; };
    listen-on-v6 { none; };
```

Others:

```
    auth-nxdomain no;    # conform to RFC1035 - yes/no answer authoritative if NXDOMAIN
    allow-transfer { none; };    # Do not transfer the zone information to the secondary DNS
```

#### named.conf.local
{:.no_toc}

```
sudo vim /etc/bind/named.conf.local
```

Declare the zones associated with this server's domain(s). Replace domain(s) and IP address(s) as appropriate for your setup:

```
### Forward zones
zone "homelab.local" {
	type master;
	file "/etc/bind/zones/homelab.zone";
	allow-update { none; };    # no DDNS by default
};

### Reverse zones
# 10.70.50.0/24 subnet
zone "50.70.10.in-addr.arpa" {
	type master;
	file "/etc/bind/zones/10.70.50.zone";
	allow-update { none; };    # no DDNS by default
};
```

#### Other configuration
{:.no_toc}

You may want to do additional configuration, such as logging, but we aren't doing any more for the sake of brevity.

> &#9432; **Note:** [https://wiki.debian.org/Bind9](https://wiki.debian.org/Bind9)

### Configure zones

```
cd /etc/bind/
sudo mkdir ./zones
sudo cp db.local ./zones/homelab.zone
sudo cp db.127 ./zones/10.70.50.zone
cd zones
```

#### homelab.zone
{:.no_toc}

```
sudo vim homelab.zone
```

Replace domain(s) and IP address(s) as appropriate for your setup:

```
;
; BIND data file for forward homelab.local
;
$TTL    604800
@       IN      SOA     druid.homelab.local. admin.homelab.local. (
                     2025030300         ; Serial
                         604800         ; Refresh
                          86400         ; Retry
                        2419200         ; Expire
                         604800 )       ; Negative Cache TTL
;
; name servers - NS records
        IN      NS      druid.homelab.local.

$ORIGIN homelab.local.

; name servers - A records
druid               IN      A       10.70.50.130

; 10.70.50.0/24
paladin             IN      A       10.70.50.104
```

> &#9432; **Note:** The serial that I've configured here is the date plus a two digit integer `YYYYMMDDxx`. It needs to be updated / incremented by at least 1 every time you make changes. You could simply make this an integer starting at 1, but that would go against my training.

> &#9432; **Note:** `$ORIGIN` defines a base name from which 'unqualified' names (those without a terminating dot) substitutions are made when processing the zone file.

#### 10.70.50.zone
{:.no_toc}

```
sudo vim 10.70.50.zone
```

Replace domain(s) and IP address(s) as appropriate for your setup:

```
;
; BIND data file for reverse 50.70.10.in-addr.arpa
;
$TTL    604800
@       IN      SOA     druid.homelab.local. admin.homelab.local. (
                     2025030300         ; Serial
                         604800         ; Refresh
                          86400         ; Retry
                        2419200         ; Expire
                         604800 )       ; Negative Cache TTL
;
; name servers - NS records
		IN      NS      druid.homelab.local.

$ORIGIN 50.70.10.in-addr.arpa.

; Name Servers - PTR Records
130      IN     PTR     druid.homelab.local.

; PTR Records
104      IN     PTR     paladin.homelab.local.
```

### Does it work?

Check your work. Is it OK?

```
named-checkzone homelab.local homelab.zone
named-checkzone 50.70.10.in-addr.arpa 10.70.50.zone
```

Restart the service. Make sure its still running properly.

```
sudo systemctl restart named
systemctl status named
```

Now what happens when we run:

```
nslookup <hostname>
nslookup <hostname> 127.0.0.1
nslookup <hostname>.homelab.local 127.0.0.1
dig @127.0.0.1 <hostname>.homelab.local
```

## Using our new DNS server

### Find your current DNS server

```
cat /etc/resolv.conf
```

> &#9432; **Note:** Don't overlook the lack of an `e` in `resolv.conf`. Tab complete is your friend.)

> &#9432; **Note:** Additionally note the `Generated by` line at the top of the file, if there is one. This may indicate that we do not want to edit this file directly.

### Setting different DNS servers

In our case, we will be using _NetworkManager_ to modify our DNS servers.

```
nmcli
nmcli connection show
```

Take note of the "Name" of the connection you are using. (NOT the "Device". Sometimes these will be the same, but not always.)

```
nmcli con mod "<connection-name>" ipv4.dns "<space-separated-dns-ips>"
nmcli con mod "<connection-name>" ipv4.ignore-auto-dns yes
nmcli con down "<connection-name>" && nmcli con up "<connection-name>"
```

```
nmcli
```

(Optional) Set a search domain

```
nmcli con mod "<connection-name>" ipv4.dns-search "<domain>"
nmcli con down "<connection-name>" && nmcli con up "<connection-name>"
```

```
nmcli
```

> &#9432; **Note:** How you modify your DNS servers will greatly vary by OS and OS version.

> &#9432; **Note:** `sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager` will add the new config, but will not remove the old, which is not ideal. This is why we are running the `up` and `down` commands for the connection. You could also reboot your pi.

### Does it work? (pt 2.)

Now what happens when we run:

```
nslookup <hostname>
nslookup <hostname>.homelab.local
dig <hostname>
dig <hostname>.homelab.local
```

## Troubleshooting

### General reminders
{:.no_toc}

Increment the serial each time you make changes!

Check your work:

```
named-checkconf
named-checkzone <zonename> <filename>
```

e.g.

```
named-checkzone homelab.local homelab.zone
named-checkzone 50.70.10.in-addr.arpa 10.70.50.zone
```

### Can you connect to port 53?
{:.no_toc}

```
telnet <remote-server> 53
```

e.g.

```
bash-3.2$ telnet 1.1.1.1 53
Trying 1.1.1.1...
Connected to one.one.one.one.
Escape character is '^]'.
```

```
nc -vz -w 1 \<remote-server\> 53
nc -vuz -w 1 \<remote-server\> 53
```

e.g.

```
bash-3.2$ nc -vz -w 1 1.1.1.1 53
Connection to 1.1.1.1 port 53 [tcp/domain] succeeded!
bash-3.2$ nc -vuz -w 1 1.1.1.1 53
Connection to 1.1.1.1 port 53 [udp/domain] succeeded!
bash-3.2$
```

### Is port 53 open?
{:.no_toc}

```
sudo netstat -tulpn | grep :53
sudo lsof -Pi | grep LISTEN
sudo nmap -sS localhost
sudo nmap -sU localhost
```

Have you configured any variety of firewall? And the follow up question, have you configured it to allow DNS / port 53? (e.g. `iptables`, `nftables`, `firewalld`, `ufw`)

> &#9432; **Note:** If you are following this guide with the same hardware/software, you should not **_need_** to configure this out of the box. I am including it because different OS'es may ship with a firewall already in place, and in practice you would want to configure this further.

### named service
{:.no_toc}

```
systemctl status named
sudo journalctl -u named
```
